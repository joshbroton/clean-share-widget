Clean Social Share Widget
=========================
A fast and JavaScript-free share widget for WordPress. 

I am sick of social share widgets doubling the time it takes my site to load. These are pure HTML/CSS and will not slow down site load.

You lose tracking, but basic tracking will be added in the future (do you really look at your tracking, anyway?).
